Use case of this project:-
1. have onboard page leads with different partners for loans and store them in DB
2. before storing the data, some checks are happening like - age, bureau and based on this check lead moves forward
3. there are 5 lenders so all leads go first primary lender and rejected leads go to 2nd lender and so on
4. the response from the lender and lead data is stored in a common table
5. have an admin/partner login screen for seeing the lead's status
6. add some authentication
